# fixed-ax25

A considerable amount of AX.25 software has been written by hobbyists or been unmaintained.

Unfortunately, a lot of it has serious security flaws, significant implementation errors
relating to the posix-likes and other problems that need to be addressed for them to be safe
for use by users with less programming experience.

This is not conductive to the continued use of the platform by amateur radio hobbyists who aren't
programmers by trade.

This project is an attempt at a clearing house for fixing those applications and keeping them fixed.

It's not this project's objective to fix radio-side stuff or say how to do things on the RF front - 
it's to make everything work on the OS-side the way it should.
